* Java: has JRE- JRE contains a JVM which compile .java into java bytecode, bytecode is then interpreted into machine language. JRE is necessary to run
java code. The advantage with this is portability, if any computer can run JRE, then all code is supported for that machine.
Example: Minecraft by Mojang, which runs entirely on Java, allows the game to run on any machine that supports Java (which is almost every machine).

*C#: has .NET Framework by Microsoft. this is compiled JIT to machine code, while .NET has a VM, it isn't used to compile the language into machine code.

*Python: Python code is entirely interpreted which means the code is "compiled" at execution of each statement, this allows the code to be executed in
any order, or from top down, and is basically running inside of a python editor, OR can be written in scripts like .java class files similarly.

Performance (gaming)
Our experiment is going to be based on gaming performance, as this is the best and easiest way to show a difference in runtime between languages,
Java, as easy as it is to learn and code in, it is not used widely for newer games, as the only video processing framework that it uses is OpenGL.
whereas C#, widely used in newer games that use the game engine Unity, utilizing the famous DirectX, newest rendition DX12 which has immense
libraries on the newest gaming technologies, most formidably Ray Tracing.
While it may cause you to think that DirectX is a much better framework, OpenGL is considerably faster than DirectX in terms of performance, and has almost
as many features. There are a few new games that use OpenGL that are still much better than their counterpart DX.
Games like Minecraft Java edition, Doom 2016, Wolfenstein, and Borderlands 3 which have great performance and graphics.
The reason why DX has a much bigger market share in todays gaming industry, is due to the fact that Microsoft owns and pushes DX to many game producers,
and that DX is easier to learn/teach.
The performance doesn't necessarily inhibit the experience, unless it is really noticeable. Both frameworks are optimized to work very well in their
games.

Game Engines
Where most of the game physics, performance, and graphics lies. This is where the differences lies between C# and Java, as well as Python.
C#: Game engines include, Unity, CryEngine, WaveEngine, Godot, Banshee, Flax, and UrhoSharp
Java: LWJGL, LibGDX, PlayN, jMonkeyEngine.
Python: Panda3D, Blender Game Engine, UPBGE
Most notable for each language:
C#: Unity - 62% market share, over half of all games are coded using Unity engine.
Java: LWJGL - the number one game in the world: Minecraft was coded using LWJGL, PlayN created the first number one mobile game on iOS and Android for multiple years, Angry Birds.
Python: Panda3D- ToonTown, an online Disney MMO, one of the most popular MMO's for it's time
